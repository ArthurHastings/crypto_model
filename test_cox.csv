2024-05-03,"Apple (AAPL) recently reported its second-quarter earnings, surpassing analyst estimates on both revenue and profitability metrics. However, not all investors are bullish on the stock, even after the tech giant announced a staggering $110 billion share buyback program. Joining Catalysts is Bireme Capital Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer Evan Tindell, who has taken a short position on Apple's stock. Tindell believes that risks ranging from fluctuating demand in China to potential antitrust concerns ""are reflected in that premium valuation"" for Apple. As the company explores integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its smartphones, he notes, ""It will be interesting to see"" if this endeavor can truly materialize into a substantial earnings driver or upstart a replacement cycle for their devices. Despite the company's announcement of a $110 billion share buyback program, Tindell remains skeptical, asserting that this move does not accurately reflect the company's valuation multiples.

2024-05-22,"Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in extended-hours trading after the chip giant topped first quarter earnings estimates and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist Lou Basenese joins Asking for a Trend to break down the earnings and analyze how long the company can keep up the momentum. Despite beating Wall Street's expectations, Basenese highlights that the magnitude of Nvidia's beat is the smallest it has ever been, at about 8%. He warns, ""Expectations at some point are going to get too far ahead of what Nvidia can deliver, but it's not yet."" ""I think it's the leading candidate to be the next $3 trillion market cap company, but if I had a dollar to put to work today and I want to 10x it, it's not Nvidia. It's probably in the smaller cap side of the market,"" he adds, saying that of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is the most ""reasonably valued."" Basenese calls Nvidia's stock split a ""brilliant move psychologically,"" as buying a stock at a lower price is more enticing. He adds that it does not change any of Nvidia's fundamental metrics or value calculations. For investors looking to get in on the AI sector, Basenese highlights Microsoft's (MSFT) ability to push AI products onto the market to create demand. He also points to Apple (AAPL) as ""the sleeper AI play.""  ""Apple is kind of perceived as they missed the boat ... they're never first or second to market. They come in later, but then they go.

Despite the positive news, Bireme Capital founder and chief investment officer Evan Tindell is short-selling both stocks and joins Catalysts to share his reasoning. ""It's been a very difficult period for shorting any stocks... but for us it kind of rhymes with the 2021 period where, of course you had the SPAC craze,"" Tindell explains. He continues, ""the growing valuations, or overvaluations in our view, of some of these stocks in 2021 contributed to huge underperformance of the Nasdaq and other sort of growth names in 2022, which allowed us to outperform by around 50%."" When it comes to Apple, Tindell is skeptical that its AI replacement cycle can drive $300 billion of value.

Candle Media Co-Founder and Co-CEO Kevin Mayer joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the 2024 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity to discuss where sports streaming fits into the broader game plan for major streaming service providers. Mayer calls sports and news ""the last bastion of pay TV"" with the future of linear television mainly coming down to sports. ""The outlook for pay television isn't great, and when sports viewers find other opportunities to watch sports, I think you'll see a continuation of that decline and a collapse, frankly, of that environment,"" Mayer says. ""But broadcast is a bit different. That doesn't depend on pay TV to get delivered to households there in every single household. And I do think you'll just see a different type of programming coming on there."" Mayer's resume also includes his tenure as the CEO of TikTok, COO of the popular app's parent company ByteDance, and the chairman of Disney's (DIS) Direct-to-Consumer & International segment.

O'Donnell explains that the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon: ""There's no official word on part of this until March of 2025, so nothing right away,"" the chief analyst says. He argues that any stock reaction to the news may be premature, particularly given Apple's incentives to make changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place.

2024-06-24,"On today's episode of Market Domination, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton discuss major market trends from Nvidia's (NVDA) slowdown to Novo Nordisk's (NVO) plans to expand manufacturing capabilities of its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. As Nvidia continues on its downward trajectory after leading the S&P 500's (^GSPC) growth, B. Riley Wealth Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan believes the market can keep up its momentum without the chip giant: ""I think it's a perfect example of a lot of folks being concerned that Nvidia and arguably Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) were such a big part of the 15% that the S&P 500 is higher this year on a year to date basis... But you're seeing basically three or four days where Nvidia has not been leading the charge, and the market's done very well. I think that continues throughout the second half of this year."" The European Union has charged Apple under its Digital Markets Act, alleging that the tech giant's App Store practices prevent app developers from directing consumers to cheaper services. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell believes the investigation is unlikely to conclude anytime soon, and that Apple will have to make some changes: ""I do think Apple is going to have to make some tweaks, some things that they don't necessarily want to do, but at the end of the day, again, it's an important enough market that they're going to have to follow some of these requirements that the EU is putting into place. And therefore, long term, I don't think the impact is that big of a deal as far as the value of the company and the way people view the stock."" Cryptocurrencies are also under pressure, with bitcoin (BTC-USD) having its worst trading day since March. Meanwhile, the health industry is making major moves, as Altimmune (ALT) reported positive results in Phase 2 trials for its weight-loss drug, a Teladoc Health (TDOC) study showed its AI models contributed to positive growth in diabetes management, and Novo Nordisk revealed plans to invest $4.1 billion in building out a manufacturing facility in Clayton, North Carolina for its GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

2024-07-02,"Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

2024-07-02,"On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, host Josh Lipton breaks down key trends and stories from Tuesday's trading day. As Americans kick off their holiday weekend, AAA Travel senior vice president Paula Twidale breaks down what Americans can expect from July Fourth travel. Twidale explains that American airports are gearing up for a record 70.9 million people traveling for the holiday, revealing that the pent-up pandemic-era travel demand isn't over: ""Consumers are not willing to give up the respite they deserve,"" she says. The Pacific Northwest, theme parks, and urban cities such as New York and Chicago are particularly popular domestic destinations, Twidale notes. However, she adds that international travel is equally high. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed at record highs in Tuesday's session. Jared Blikre breaks down his three biggest takeaways from the trading day: Tesla shares closing above $200, market concentration topping the 1929 peak, and the dip in stock volatility. Rising home prices and high mortgage rates are shutting out would-be US homebuyers. Angi co-founder Angie Hicks explains that Americans who would have thought about moving are now thinking about renovation. According to Angi's home spending reports, bathrooms are consistently in the top five renovation projects, while kitchens are in the top 10. Outdoor remodeling remains popular even in post-pandemic times, she adds. Seana Smith joins the show to analyze a new Wells Fargo chart showing the potential rebalancing of earnings growth in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Wells Fargo notes that earnings growth will broaden beyond the ""Magnificent 7,"" while participation and profitability outside of tech and communication services will also broaden.

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

Stock futures sank after the US added far fewer jobs than expected in July, 114,000 versus the 175,000 estimate. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.3%. It's raising questions about whether or not the Federal Reserve has waited too long to start cutting rates. Big Tech earnings are in focus. Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results. The company is still showing weakness in China, but iPad sales and Services revenue both topped Street estimates.

Its Q3 guidance was also disappointing. Intel (INTC) shares are plunging after its second quarter results missed on both the top and bottom lines. The company also issued guidance that was worse than expected, announced job cuts, and said it's suspending its dividend.

2024-08-09,"On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills dig into this week's market volatility, from jobless claims data to the yen carry trade unwinding. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, ""Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no."" The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. ""Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings,"" he explains. He adds, ""When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes."" A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, ""The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade."" Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, ""Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).""

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

2024-08-13,"Market volatility spurred by recession fears rocked the tech sector last week, causing large-cap names to come under pressure. Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the tech industry sa recession fears circulate. If July's Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes in higher than expected and interest rates start to come down, Wagner argues that the Magnificent Seven will ""continue to be that funding mechanism, much like what we saw in the middle of July."" ""You saw that capital flow from the Magnificent Seven to some of the smaller-cap cohorts to more of the real estate investment trust areas, the utilities, and even some of the more consumer cyclical and the consumer discretionary area,"" he says. Wagner notes that the flow of capital will remain with the Magnificent Seven because ""there's so much resiliency, there's so much pricing in elasticity that a lot of those companies have."" While the safe move 10 years ago was to invest in staples like utilities, Wagner believes it is now in AI tech names: ""The amount of profit margin and operating leverage that a lot of these Magnificent Seven companies have, that's where the flow of capital is going to go if investors are looking for safety. And so if you think that there's going to be volatility in the market, not just here in the near term, but over say the next three to four months, I'd be putting my capital in the Mag Seven.""

CNET editor-at-large Bridget Carey joins Wealth! to talk about the best consumer tech deals ahead of the Labor Day Weekend and as retailers shift focus farther down the road to the holiday season.

2024-08-28,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) trimmed its stake in Apple (AAPL) by over 50% at the beginning of August. Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: ""Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there."" He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is ""finding places to play,"" but ultimately is ""waiting for better valuation."" Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

2024-09-10,"Just after Apple (AAPL) unveiled the new iPhone 16 on Monday, Huawei Technologies, a Chinese phone maker, announced a new trifold device. Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan joined Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss how the new Huawei phone could affect competition in the China region. Huawei ""is a formidable competitor"" to Apple amid increased competition in the China market, Mohan tells Yahoo Finance. Mohan argues the combination of Apple Intelligence and competition from the new Huawei device is ""relatively net neutral"" for Apple in the country, highlighting that the iPhone maker said support for Apple Intelligence in the Chinese language is coming in 2025. ""Apple will continue to take share in China in the long run,"" Mohan said. Apple is ""giving up some cyclical share"" in the near term, he noted, adding that Bank of America analysts are ""very optimistic about the China potential"" in the long term as the middle class grows in the region. ""All of that is going to add incremental users into the Apple ecosystem."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

2024-09-10,"Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Catalysts Host Madison Mills sit down with Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the state of media and tech companies, from Apple (AAPL) to Disney (DIS). On Monday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest product offerings at its highly anticipated ""It's Glowtime"" event in Cupertino, California. Ng explains that the event ""delivered in line with investor expectations,"" noting that historically, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 70 basis points on announcement days, and following the event, it underperformed by about 100 basis points. ""We think that was in line with historical events. And when you look at the individual product announcements, it came in mostly as expected,"" he adds. Ng reiterates his Buy rating on Apple, arguing that ""there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones."" He continues, ""We think that investors have historically thought about Apple iPhones at a normalized sell-through rate at about 225 to 230 million units. And we think that AI and some of the new product features that are going to get rolled out over the next few years is going to bring that normalized run rate closer to 250 to 260 million."" While there is debate among investors as to whether AI will be the demand driver for Apple, Ng is bullish on the technology. He also highlights that hardware changes will also drive an upgrade cycle as screen sizes increase, devices become thinner, and rumors that the iPhone 18 may potentially be foldable. Turning to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Ng believes that the company is managing its video business holistically. ""The linear TV network business is certainly having challenges. Cord cutting is unrelenting, and paid TV subscriber declines will continue to occur. That being said, it's an incredibly cash-generative business and it helps to fund growth investments elsewhere in the Warner Brothers portfolio,"" he explains. He points to momentum in its streaming platform Max, and argues that ""there's a crown jewel in the Warner Brothers film and television studio."" Meanwhile, Ng believes that one of Disney's (DIS) biggest challenges will be its succession planning. Investors have praised the company's growth under CEO Bob Iger, and Ng notes that before Iger's return to the company, Disney faced ""a few missteps,"" especially in its film and TV divisions. ""I think there's a tremendous amount of focus on what that succession planning looks like. One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios, and obviously at ESPN,"" Ng tells Yahoo Finance.

The analyst said he expects ""better growth over the next year, which will contribute to stock price outperformance."" Flax said that Nvidia (NVDA) stands to gain as cloud vendors like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) invest in artificial intelligence (AI) despite near-term volatility amid Blackwell delays. He says the key for Nvidia ""is to continue to execute on its product cycles."" After Oracle (ORCL) stock jumped following its first quarter earnings beat, Flax noted positive feedback from Oracle's cloud customers.

2024-09-12,"Semiconductor stocks rallied in Wednesday's trading session after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang highlighted ""great"" demand for AI chips. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates ""a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings."" While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: ""I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet."" He argues that Oracle is ""one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward."" He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the ""expansive market"" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a ""proxy for Apple (AAPL),"" noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be ""unabated"" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, ""What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x."" ""So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here,"" he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

2024-09-19,"Tech stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points, with some of the Magnificent Seven names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge. Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss how to play the tech sector. “It's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,” Chronert says. “The leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600."" “Essentially what you have here… is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.” Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citi’s view on the group: “We've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.” He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — who control over 6% of the index — ""those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today. But, what we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now. It's beginning to decelerate.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

2024-09-20,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading week. US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened in negative territory, just one morning after the market rallied on the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched new record highs. John Hancock investment management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland explains, “It's six straight days of gains leading markets higher [and] riskier assets are really celebrating this idea that the Fed can stave off a hard landing, prevent a contraction from happening, do it proactively before we see more weakness here in the labor market."" As mega-cap tech stocks gain and September's interest rate cut sent markets higher, Raymond James Investment Management chief market strategist Matt Orton still likes the Big Tech sector: “There's plenty of reasons that clients still want to own the mega-cap technology names. Especially the high-quality ones that are generating $50 [billion], $60 [billion], $70 billion of free cash flow per year. But what I've been encouraging clients really for the past three months or so is that we have an opportunity to build better balance in our portfolios.” Shares of Nike (NKE) are rallying after the company announced that CEO John Donahoe will be stepping down next month after a rocky five years at the company. Nike veteran Elliott Hill will come out of retirement to fill the role of CEO and president effective October 14. Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih believes that Hill will prioritize relationships with wholesale retail partners as he steps into the role: ""It's the base for kind of the brand strength going forward. And even though it's margin dilutive, when you're a $50 billion global footprint brand, you need both channels to be working in your favor."" She argues that Hill is the right person for the job, explaining that he's well-liked at the company, and before his retirement, his positions at Nike focused on the global marketplace. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 16 lineup is here and consumers are already coming in droves to get their hands on the new device. Yahoo Finance anchor Josh Lipton reports live from the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City where the new iPhones are already being sold, an occasion marked by CEO Tim Cook opening the doors to customers. Investors can brace for more volatility in Friday's trading session as more than $5 trillion in options are set to expire. The event, known on Wall Street as ""Triple Witching,"" sees contracts tied to individual stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds expire. Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills joins Morning Brief to break down this trading phenomenon. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",0.0002294106088811,0.9976701140403748,0.0021005044691264

However, the release of the iPhone 16 comes without the tech giant’s AI features — dubbed Apple Intelligence — which is slated for an October rollout. “We're very much in the early days of AI, a lot of questions by consumers around the benefits” says TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell. O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance that there are some “fundamental challenges” right now in Apple's push for a device upgrade cycle, affirming that he is still a big believer in AI in the long run. As for the smartphone business overall? O'Donnell says it has stalled as consumers wait longer to upgrade their smartphones: ""The hope was that these AI features from Apple would be that trigger for change, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen for a while.""

2024-10-01,"As the Nasdaq (^IXIC) is down the most out of the three major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC), investors may be wondering if now is the time to buy on the dip. Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. “We have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,” Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, “We are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.” The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners “used more indirect exposure than direct buying,” with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) “that have significant weighting to these names.” He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were ""within the context of also adding to things like"" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). ""I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.” Browne also has focused on ""standouts within leading sectors."" He says ""Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.""

2024-10-08,"Most Magnificent Seven tech stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, and the tech sector is attempting a recovery from a lackluster third quarter. The Magnificent Seven is currently comprised of Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Market Domination to discuss how investors can best play the tech sector. Many investors were disappointed during the second quarter earnings season as they looked for significant returns on their AI plays. Rizzo expects this theme to also prevail over the upcoming tech earnings season. However, he argues, ""when I look at the return on investment for the hyperscalers and for the entire technology sector, I actually think we're starting to see it."" He points to Meta Platforms (META) as an example, explaining, ""At one point during the year, people thought that Meta would have Q4 growth rates in the mid-single digits. Now, that number is closer to 20%. And why is that? That's because they've been able to use AI to get a lot better targeting in their core advertising business."" He also believes that Apple (AAPL) will see the beginning of an upgrade cycle as it offers AI capabilities on its iPhone 16 series. In addition, he argues that Nvidia (NVDA) is in the best position as the company is ""selling the linchpin technology to all of these vendors."" While the Magnificent Seven has been under pressure, Rizzo tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think the divergence that we've seen amongst the Magnificent Seven, and between the Mag Seven and the S&P 493, is really quite natural."" Rizzo notes that the Magnificent Seven has historically grown earnings at a rate of 50 to 100% faster than the rest of the S&P 500. He expects that to continue over the medium term, especially as many of the Magnificent Seven players are well-positioned for AI. However, at this moment, he explains that they are trading only at a 50% premium to the rest of the market, making them cheaper based on a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. He finds AI will continue to drive innovation and push further growth in mega-cap tech names. With this dynamic at play, Rizzo expects the AI chip market to grow to $400 billion by 2027.

2024-11-01,"Apple (AAPL) may have beat fiscal fourth quarter revenue estimates with $94.9 billion (estimates were for $94.3 billion), but adjusted earnings fell far below Wall Street's expectations due to a one-time charge from a European General Court decision. While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. ""It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit,"" Forte says. ""So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing"" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a ""real risk"" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

2024-11-01,"Apple's (AAPL) earnings bring Apple Intelligence into focus as the iPhone maker rolls out its artificial intelligence (AI) features, hoping to drive an accelerated device upgrade cycle. Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the ""unpredictability"" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. ""It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before."" ""I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers,"" he says, but notes that ""Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features."" The analyst says while Apple is ""in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software,"" he worries ""that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices.""

Mahoney tells retail investors, ""Don't get involved in this. You know there's a lot of emotion, and I know it's easy for me to say that, but the last thing you want to do is get whipsawed out of your position ... Our Founding Fathers kind of figured this out, that we have a balance of power and after this election, we're still going to have a balance of power."" He adds there are ""so many tailwinds,"" including the Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday, Big Tech companies' artificial intelligence (AI) spending, and strong earnings. ""You have a lot of bears [that have] been on the sidelines. They're going to have to commit capital toward the end of the year. Otherwise, the index is going to be way ahead of them. So again, I just say that sometimes we lose sight. We have to come back [and] see where we are, and there's a really strong tailwind despite who wins."" He highlights, ""Our favorites are still the market leaders"" like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). ""That's the way we've been playing this right now is some of your best stocks you like with the added volatility. Make volatility your friend, not your foe.

2024-11-11,"Following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election, tech CEOs were quick to send congratulatory messages. However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. ""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Co-founded by CEO Michael Mager and neurosurgeon and engineer Ben Rapoport, Precision Neuroscience began in 2021 with three former employees of Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Precision Neuroscience is developing its version of an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) technology meant to help individuals with neurological disorders, such as ALS, to better function and communicate. Mager says Precision Neuroscience's technology is high-bandwidth, sits on ""the surface of the brain without doing any damage,"" and is reversible.  In an interview with Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Yasmin Khorram from the Yahoo Invest conference, Mager discusses the company's road ahead and potential market, what to expect from the upcoming Trump presidency, and a possible IPO. “We view brain computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation,” says Mager. “This is gonna have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas.” To see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

2024-12-04,"A Santa Claus rally is coming for technology stocks, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. The senior equity research analyst sees several factors driving the market darlings higher into the end of the year, ranging from expectations about loosened regulation from the incoming Trump administration to increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the US government. The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).

I do still think this is going to be a stronger-than-normal upgrade cycle only because we've known that this is an aging base."" Bajarin went out to talk about the partnership between Apple and Sam Altman's OpenAI, the company that develops ChatGPT. ""I think OpenAI, they're not Google.

We got past sort of the uncertainty about direction right at the top level for the country."" ""The second piece is specific to Apple. If you look at their business, I think that the iPhone numbers, and investors seem to realize this, for next year, are kind of de-risked. I mean, expectations are low... There's really no expectation for AI adding much of anything to Apple over the next year."" On the reports of Apple working on a chip, Clinton says ""Any company that is playing in the AI space that has over $1 billion market cap, we think, they have to develop their own silicon. It's just a matter of time for any of those companies who aren't doing it. Apple was obviously always involved in making their own silicon for their devices. Now, they're bringing that into the server and doing it for their particular use case in AI.

""The first and most obvious is that each can work side by side to solve a problem synergistically. For example, you might use AI to predict product demand in the future and then use quantum computing to optimize the supply chain to meet that demand."" ""Second, we are doing a fair amount of work right now on how quantum computing could be used as part of the model training and inference for AI."" The CEO explains, ""Because of the fact that [quantum is] so much faster than classical [computing] and requires so much less power, we think that we may be able to support model training and inference with much lower power consumption than what's happening today, which could be a game-changer.""

2024-12-16,"2024 has been ""one big valuation surprise"" that has been ""dominated by the [Magnificent] Seven megacap growth cohort,"" Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chonert tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination. The strategist says not only does the Magnificent Seven group, made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Apple (AAPL), has more room to run in 2025, the stocks could actually function as a defensive play amid market uncertainty. ""We're thinking the Mag Seven actually unfold as a quasi staple,"" Chronert says, explaining, ""Usually you go to [consumer] staples when you have uncertain economic conditions because of the persistence of earnings growth."" ""The Mag Seven, we think, that forward-looking earnings growth for certainly for [2025] and probably into [2026] is fairly visible. So all told, when you get concerned about other things at work in the market and the economy, the Mag Seven actually have this potential to be a quote, defensive if you will."" The strategist highlights the phrase ""growth is defensive,"" saying, ""That's what's going on here."" He notes, ""These companies probably can't just live on meeting expectations. They need to continue to meet beat and then probably raise forward expectations as well"" to maintain their ""defensive"" status.

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. ""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen."" ""It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,"" Mayfield adds.

Johnson shares his strategy for navigating the shifting tech landscape in the coming year. ""I would rather see investors — and I suspect this will happen as you get into early 2025 — taking some, not all, but some of their profits out of those larger cap stocks, reducing those positions, and then again, recognizing some of those gains that they may not have wanted to recognize in 2024 and [shifting] down cap, looking at stocks like Twilio (TWLO)."" He also highlights Robinhood (HOOD) as an opportunity for investors, given the ""more friendly crypto policy from the new administration.""

2025-01-02,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

While acknowledging their ""tremendous"" returns, he cautions, ""That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now.""

VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. ""That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. ""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

2025-02-11,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a new iPhone SE sometime this week, which could play a crucial role in the company’s smartphone business. The iPhone developer is reportedly partnering with Alibaba (BABA) to further expands its artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, according to a report by The Information. TECHnalysis Research president Bob O'Donnell discusses on Asking for a Trend how the iPhone SE, with its smaller form factor and lower price, appeals to customers who prefer compact devices. ""The [iPhone] SE has never been a huge part of the iPhone market in terms of a percentage, but there is a very distinct group of people who just don't really like huge phones. And, the SE has served that market,"" O'Donnell says. While the SE may not drive massive sales, it serves a niche market, particularly in emerging regions where its affordability is key. O'Donnell comments on Apple's new AI partnership with Alibaba as the tech giant seeks to further penetrate China's consumer tech market: ""This is something that we knew had to be coming, not necessarily with Alibaba. But in order for Apple to bring Apple intelligence to China they were going to have to find a Chinese partner, and it's well known that Chinese consumers are very interested in AI capabilities.""

2025-02-24,"Longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller on Monday conceded he initially opposed fees that the iPhone maker charges for in app-transactions processed outside its own payment system because he feared violating a court-ordered mandate designed to create more competition.  Schiller, who oversees Apple's lucrative App Store for iPhones, made the admission during three hours of testimony in the same Oakland federal courtroom where he last appeared on the witness stand nearly nine months ago as part of a long-running legal battle with Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game.  Epic began the showdown four and half years ago when it first filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce.",0.922327160835266,0.0668965801596641,0.0107761938124895

2025-02-25,"Apple (AAPL) and its CEO, Tim Cook, announced plans to invest $500 billion in US operations over the next four years, which President Trump could leverage in his dealings with other chief executives. Christoff & Co. CEO Niki Christoff joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss how Apple's latest developments could factor into the Trump administration's strategy. ""Tim Cook and Apple are at the very front edge of this, of making commitments and giving good headlines, and the president wants to move fast on the things that he has promised. And that is America first, including having American companies make things here,"" Christoff says. The alignment between business success and the administration's goals creates a dynamic where companies are more inclined to cooperate. However, Christoff notes that not all CEO's share the same ideological views. ""I'd say people have described Tim Cook as 10% political and 90% business person, and I think that's right,"" she says. Regarding potential government interference within tech, Christoff asserts, “President Trump sees himself as a business person and he loves business success. So, no, I don’t think he’s actually going to kneecap American tech companies.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
